Mutation:
1) Range of mean selection
2) Mutate covariance?

Adjusting weights
1) Store weights for all members
2) Init weights non-uniformly?

Minimum MDL vs true MDL
1) Some peaks may merge (thus fewer clusters)
2) Some peaks may overlap and distort estimates
3) Global minimum != true model

Applications
1) Synthetic data
2) PCA on Pendigit data with 2,3,4 eigenvalues kept -- compare MDL values

Approximations
1) Using MDL as tradeoff between accuracy and cluster # (weight differently?)
2) Global vs local minima

Tradeoff of R vs accuracy vs time


TODO--
xx 0) Check that it is working as intended
J 1) Initialization with k-means
xx 2) Compute the true MDL values for the sample data by generating an individual with the input weights, means, and covariances. We can compare these to the results of GA-EM and EM.
W 3) Apply it to other data sets
Q 4) (MODEL SELECTION) Play around with various configuration parameters to see if there are better choices
xx 5) See if my code and Tim’s code provide similar results =P
xx 6) Apply it to synthetic data and real data to see the difference in behavior
W 7) Dimension reduction using PCA for Pendigit data and then apply the code to the PCA-transformed data
W 8) Search for any possible improvements on the method. The professor mentioned we should also discuss competitors, possible extensions, etc. This can be explored along with (4), (6).
T (9) Compare runtime/complexity of both algorithms
Although GA_EM generally gives better MDL, it also takes more time to run. Perhaps play around with parameter R as trade-off between accuracy and computation time?
